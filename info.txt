1) Addon position works in multiples of 16. Placement boxes work in multiples of 32 (although multiples of 16 affect addon positioning).
2) Images need a death iscript if they are sticking around after unit death

3) how I got defense matrix to be castable without turning on non-lifted off support tower (starbase):
a) Hijack Irradiate, or some other targeting spell*. 
a1) Set irradiate to have the same targeting (ground/air/own/nonbuilding)/range/energy cost as dmatrix.
a2) Have the button for defense matrix's action be irradiate (leave condition as dmatrix). Make sure to also set the use tech dat requirement for irradiate.
*The GPTP plugin's cast order hook does not trigger for defense matrix, so this is necessary. 
*Defense matrix is different than similar spells (such as restoration) since it does not have an associated weapon.
b) Modify the cast order hook
b1) Check if the caster is starbase and casting irradiate. If so, replace the tech used variable with that of defense matrix.*
*This isn't strictly necessary, especially if the energy costs are the same since that's the only thing it's used for at time of writing.
b2) At the very end of the function, after all checks are done, manually "cast" defense matrix.
That is to say, add the sprites, play the sounds, add the dmatrix variables to the target manually. Don't forget to account for an existing dmatrix.
Also tell the unit to idle to cancel the irradiate order.*
*Normally, when you attempt to cast a spell on an out of range unit (and can't reach it), the icon stays "white" (the unit is still trying to perform the order).
This hack doesn't keep that behavior; the order never turns white.
!!!!! Note: this effectively overrides the dmatrix exe edits in Firegraft, so keep that in mind.
