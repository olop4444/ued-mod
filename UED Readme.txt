	After news of the UED Expeditionary Force's defeat reached Earth, military leaders were stunned. They
had severly underestimated the inhabitants of the Korpulu sector. In response, they sent their most advanced
fleet to conquer the Zerg, Protoss, and Terrans once and for all.
	This time, they will take no prisoners. 
	This time, they will leave no survivors. 
	This time, there can only be victory.

Gameplay: UED units are strong, but gas-heavy. 
Most units come equipped with combat shields. However, a Shield Generator must be built before they will work. 
If it is destroyed, then the shields are once again disabled.

Crystals (Uraj, Khalis, etc.) will crash the game, due to my cannibalization of their iscript.
