	After news of the UED Expeditionary Force's defeat reached Earth, military leaders were stunned. They
had severly underestimated the inhabitants of the Korpulu sector. In response, they sent their most advanced
fleet, the true might of the UED, to conquer the Zerg, Protoss, and Terrans once and for all.
	This time, they will take no prisoners. 
	This time, they will leave no survivors. 
	This time, there can only be victory.
