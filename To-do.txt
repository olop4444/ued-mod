Shield generator:
watch lag?

RAVAGER:
sprite max out?

HARD/optional:
titan attack while moving indefinitely
ravager irradiate damage upgrade
support tower selectable in group
AI

MISC graphics/QOL:
dropship loading on right click (might be due to weapon)
height of missile tank turret siege mode
wireframes for buildings (barracks, academy, phys lab)
falcon voice lines
wyvern/falcon/revenant thrusters
prevent shield aura from being cast if no shield generator available

uniqueness:
terran shields block 1 damage instance each? might be too hard to balance

Patch notes:
- Added Aegis Protection upgrade to Titan - every 10 seconds, if the Titan has not been damaged within 10 seconds, add 1 layer of Force Field, up to 3.
Force Field overrides this (does not stack).
- Reduced upgrade cost/time of Ravager's speed movement upgrade from 250->200, 2750->2000, respectively.
- Force Field (DMatrix) now lasts for exactly 15 attacks instead of 250 damage.

Fixes:
fixed u8 overflow for support tower shield aura energy drain
fixed dmatrix not disappearing on subunits
