Shield generator:
fix lag
ideas:
every x frames
use cloaking field with global/static fields?
use location and triggers (see api.h)
last resort:
no regen or global regen

/////
support tower spell which temporarily adds shield regen/hp regen/armor aura (1 of the 3)
researchable?

RAVAGER:
sprite max out?

HARD/optional:
titan attack while moving indefinitely
defensive matrix self cast on BC
ravager irradiate damage upgrade
support tower selectable in group
support tower gets activateable ability which drains energy and allows shield recharge (at accelerated rate?)
AI

MISC graphics/QOL:
dropship loading on right click (might be due to weapon)
height of missile tank turret siege mode
wireframes for buildings (barracks, academy, phys lab)
falcon voice lines
wyvern/falcon/revenant thrusters

patch notes:
added support tower energy upgrade (firegraft exe edit no longer works)
fixed defense matrix overlay - it now uses overlay flags rather than unit combat size
core overload energy cost 150->200
