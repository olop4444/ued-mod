Shield generator:
watch lag?

RAVAGER:
sprite max out?

HARD/optional:
titan attack while moving indefinitely
ravager irradiate damage upgrade
support tower selectable in group
AI

MISC graphics/QOL:
dropship loading on right click (might be due to weapon)
height of missile tank turret siege mode
wireframes for buildings (barracks, academy, phys lab)
falcon voice lines
wyvern/falcon/revenant thrusters
prevent shield aura from being cast if no shield generator available

uniqueness:
terran shields block 1 damage instance each? might be too hard to balance

Fixes:
With dmatrix code no longer overlapping with RPGLauncher code on irradiate, fixed RPG Launcher cost/targeting problems.

Patch:
Sniper hp 40->35, shields 0->5
