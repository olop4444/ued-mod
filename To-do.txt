SHIELD (terran units only):
no shield generator: 0 shield when built, 0 shield regen
shield generator: full shields when built, normal shield regen (in aoe? with support towers as "extenders"?)
shield generator destroyed: shields set to 0 + no shield generator effects
^^^all possible with triggers
//////
ALTERNATIVE
units start with 0 (or full?) shields, and cannot regen
shield generator is available and can use recharge shields <- not possible

RAVAGER:
crash/sticky sprites if it dies mid-overload*
sprite max out?

SUPPORT TOWER:
DMatrix -> get grounded cast to work (recharge shields? photon cannon? attack angle?)*

HARD/optional:
titan attack while moving indefinitely
defensive matrix self cast on BC
ravager irradiate damage upgrade
support tower selectable in group

AI

MISC graphics/QOL:
dropship loading on right click (might be due to weapon)
height of missile tank turret siege mode
wireframes for buildings (barracks, academy, phys lab)
falcon voice lines
wyvern/falcon/revenant thrusters

REDO:
training facility addon height (relative to facility)

BALANCE:
reduce rpg launcher to 35 + 15? increase cost to 150?
reduce defensive mode armor from 3 to 2

patch notes:
reduced overdrive cost (20->15), as 20 seemed bugged (wouldn't always drain hp)
