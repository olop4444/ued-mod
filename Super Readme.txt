||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||| Backstory |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||

	After news of the UED Expeditionary Force's defeat reached Earth, military leaders were stunned. They
had severly underestimated the Zerg, Protoss, and Terrans. In response, they sent their most advanced fleet to destroy the Zerg, Protoss, and Terrans once and for all.
	This time, they will take no prisoners. This time, they will be victorious. This time, there will 
only be destruction. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Creator's Note~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
	The story and setting of the campaign are all based on the events in the Starcraft and 
Starcraft: Brood War campaigns. There are 4 races, the Protoss, Zerg, Terran (collectively referred to as 
"natives" in the campaign), and the UED, the only one that is modded. The campaign's final battle 
(Waterloo II) can be played as either side, with minor changes to the map layout, most of them making it 
harder for you to win. :P

_______________________________________Comprehensive Strategy Guide_______________________________________


Gameplay: The playstyle is a cross of the Protoss and Terran. The units are fairly expensive but powerful. 
A Shield Generator must be built before shields are enabled. If it is destroyed, then the shields are once
again disabled.

Crystals (Uraj, Khalis, etc.) will crash the game, due to my cannibalization of their iscript.

 Devastating vs. Protoss (full damage to shields) and infantry.
Bad vs. vehicles and non-Protoss buildings. Attacks ground and air.


Infiltrator- Role: Scouting Spellcaster 
 Slightly bad vs. most units, because it is not meant for battle. Attacks ground only.
SPELLS: Lay Spy Drone (detector and high sight range), Cloak, Shutdown (lockdown for mechanical units AND buildings)

Attacks ground and air. Medium splash damage. Low accuracy.
Bad vs. medium and large units.

SPELLS: RPG Launcher- fires a 30 (+5) projectile that does explosive splash damage.

----Vehicles----

Sphinx- Role: Light Assault Vehicle
High rate of fire, but its attack does explosive damage, rendering it ineffective against small units.
 Good vs. air, Average vs. buildings and vehicles. Very bad vs. infantry. Attacks ground and air.

Missile Tank- Role: Heavy Assault Vehicle
Can attack from outside a turret's range.
 Excels against buildings. Good vs. ranged units. Very bad vs. melee units and infantry. 
Large splash damage for ground attack only. Attacks ground and air. (air attack different)

ABILITY: 

Defensive Mode: Increases the Missile Tank's armor to 5 and makes it a detector, but renders it immobile.
Can return to regular mode.

Titan- Role: Heavy Anti-Personnel Vehicle
Extremely high rate of fire and its attack has a factor of two making armor highly effective against 
its weaponry.
 Devastating vs. infantry, Good vs. lightly armored units in general (a unit with  1 or less base armor).
Attacks ground and air. Minor splash damage.

----Air----

Wyvern- Role: Medium Fighter 
Constant stream of damage, this makes armor extra effective against its attack.
 Good vs. most units. Bad vs. most anti-air ground units. Attacks ground and air.

Auxiliary Fighter- Role: Support Aircraft
It is a support unit that can attack as well. After a battle it can repair damaged units.
 Slightly bad vs. most units. Good vs. clumped units. Attacks ground and air. Medium splash damage.
ABILITY: Repair 
SPELLS: 

Valkryie- Role: Air Superiority Fighter
Nothing new.
 Good vs. air units, especially when clumped together. Attacks air only. Large splash damage.

Revenant- Role: Transportation
This transport unit can cloak and defend itself, but it has less transport slots. It is also slightly 
expensive. A large amount of Revenants can defend itself against enemy air units, but it's best just to run.
 Slightly bad vs. everything. Average vs. air in large numbers (6+ Revenant).
Has 6 transport slots.
SPELLS: Cloak

Ravager- Role: Heavy Demolitions Warship
Ground attack is close range (bomb). The Ravager is fairly slow, so most ranged ground units can micro 
and kill a Ravager. Its Nuclear Blast ability is devastating to an attacking force.
 Good vs. light air, buildings. Bad vs. anit-air ground units. Attacks ground and air. (air attack different)
Large splash damage for ground and air attack.
SPELLS: Nuclear Blast (nuclear explosion, can not harm itself)

----Turrets----

Shock Turret- Role: Support Turret
Ground attack is an EMP blast which is useful against Protoss and spellcasters, air attack is a
Lockdown missile that stops enemy air units in their tracks. However, the turret cannot damage them and will
need backup to destroy the lockdowned units.
 Good vs. air, Archons.

Laser Turret- Role: Defensive Turret
 Average vs. most units.

===========Battle Plans===========

----Generic Strategies----

1. Soldiers & Medics- Similiar to Marines & Medics. 
 Pros: 
Fairly cheap 
Reasonably durable 
 Cons: 
Won't work against lurkers or zealots

How:
 Same as M&M, if they get many lurkers or zealots you need to change strategies; get vehicular support.

 Best used against Zerg.

2. Mass Sphinxes- 
 Pros: 
Relatively inexpensive 
Decent vs. buildings 
 Cons: 
Won't work well against muta/ling or M&M
 
How:
 Get factory when you normally would, then mass Sphinxes. Against melee units or M&M some micro is required.

 Best used against Zerg.

3. Mass Titans- Make sure to keep up with the opponent's upgrades! If you don't this won't work.
 Pros: 
Can tear through infantry and is decent against other units
 Cons: 
Somewhat expensive
Won't work well against metal

How:
 Get factory when you normally would, quickly get armory (within a minute of factory), then mass Titans. Keep
getting upgrades. If the opponent is getting mostly high-armored units (metal, ultralisks) you should get 
backup (Air, Sphinxes, and/or Missile Tanks).

 Best used against Zerg.

4. Mass Revenants- 
 Pros: 
Works fairly well against any unit combo 
They are highly mobile due to speed and flight ability 
They are able to cloak 
 Cons: 
Somewhat expensive 
Won't work well against a dedicated anti-air force (such as goliaths)

How: 
 Same as mass wraiths, except weapon upgrades are more important.

 Best against any race.

5. Tech to Ravagers & Nuclear Blast- 
 Pros: 
Immense damage output
 Cons: 
Fairly expensive 
Takes awhile to get 
You are extremely vulnerable before a Ravager gets their Nuclear Blast ready

How:
 Turtle in at your natural expansion, medium or fast tech to Ravagers and Nuclear Blast (depending on how much 
the opponent attacks; if he attacks a lot=medium tech, medium/rarely=fast tech). Then take at least 3 full 
energy Ravagers to take each expo (2 to take, 1 to defend). While the command center/hatchery/nexus is 
building, send as many forces as you can spare to hold it. Repeat as necessary.

 Best used against a computer (any race).

----Armies----

1. Ground Army- Titans, Sphinxes, ECVs, infantry support, and possibly Missile Tanks.
 Pros: 
Decent against most units: Titans for light units, Sphinxes for medium and air units, infantry for all, 
and Missile Tanks for buildings (and sunkens/cannons if the opponent has a lot of them) 
The ECVs can repair
 Cons: 
The Missile Tanks could easily splash damage your own units; don't let that happen
The army is not very mobile because they are ground units 
It can be easily overwhelmed if flanked at a narrow passage
 

2. Air Army- A mixed force of Revenants, Valkryies, and Auxiliary Fighters.
 Pros: 
Can repair itself after a fight; this eliminates the need to go back to one of your bases to repair 
It is highly mobile because the units are airborne and have a reasonably fast speed 
Can escort Revenants to the drop point
High ground is not an issue
 Cons: 
Not very effective against ground units, especially anti-air ones (like goliaths)
Takes awhile to get the air force

3. Mixed Army- Sphinxes, Titans, Auxiliary Fighters, Revenants.
 Pros: 
Can repair itself 
Good against most units: Titans for light units, Sphinxes for medium and air units, the air units can do well 
against most units as well 
Air units can also pick off enemy units that are on cliffs or out of range of your ground units
 Cons:
Expensive
Vulnerable to very heavy units (such as ultralisks)
If told to go somewhere, the air units will get there first (if not microed), and will be very vulnerable

4. Anti-air Army- Sphinxes, Titans, Valkryies


----Counters----

---Zerg---

1. Muta/ling: Mass Titans. They are good against both mutalisks and zerglings. Make sure the mutalisks don't 
pick off your Titans one by one.

2. Lurker/ling: Go metal. Titans will make short work of the zerglings and are decent against the lurkers. The 
Sphinxes and/or Missile Tanks can finish the lurkers off.

3. Ultra/ling: No good counter for this one. A combo of Titans and Sphinxes is good though.

4. Mass hydras: Soldiers & Medics OR Missile Tanks should be able to take on the mass hydra menace. 


---Protoss---

1. Zealots and Dragoons: 

2. Reaver/sair: Have Auxiliary Fighters patrol your base and expos. They aren't affected by d-web, 
and they can kill both the reavers and shuttles. If you want them to fight the corsairs, have at least 1.5 Auxiliary 
Fighters for each corsair.

3. Mass carriers: Go mass Sphinxes. And don't forget to focus fire on the carriers.


---Terran---


---UED---
